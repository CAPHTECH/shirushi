principles:
  - id: BACK-P001
    name: "Service Autonomy"
    description: "Each service should be independently deployable and operable"
    rationale: |
      Service autonomy enables teams to move faster and reduces coupling
      between different parts of the system.
    examples:
      - "Backend services have their own databases"
      - "Services communicate via well-defined APIs"
      - "No shared state between services"

  - id: BACK-P002
    name: "API-First Design"
    description: "APIs are designed before implementation"
    rationale: |
      API-first approach ensures that interfaces are well-thought-out
      and meet consumer needs before development begins.
    examples:
      - "OpenAPI specifications created first"
      - "API reviews before coding"
      - "Consumer feedback incorporated early"

  - id: BACK-P003
    name: "Observability by Default"
    description: "All services emit structured logs, metrics, and traces"
    rationale: |
      Observability is critical for operating distributed systems.
      It should be built in from the start, not added later.
    examples:
      - "Structured JSON logging"
      - "Prometheus metrics"
      - "OpenTelemetry tracing"

  - id: BACK-P004
    name: "Graceful Degradation"
    description: "Services should degrade gracefully when dependencies fail"
    rationale: |
      In a distributed system, failures are inevitable. Services should
      continue to provide value even when some functionality is unavailable.
    examples:
      - "Circuit breakers for external calls"
      - "Fallback values for non-critical data"
      - "Cached responses when services are down"

  - id: BACK-P005
    name: "Zero-Downtime Deployments"
    description: "Deployments should not cause service interruptions"
    rationale: |
      Continuous deployment requires the ability to deploy changes
      without impacting users.
    examples:
      - "Blue-green deployments"
      - "Rolling updates"
      - "Feature flags for gradual rollout"

implementation_guidelines:
  - "All new services must follow these principles"
  - "Existing services should be refactored to comply over time"
  - "Exceptions require architecture review approval"

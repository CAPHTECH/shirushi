# Welcome to Shirushi

This is an example document with a valid document ID.

## What is a doc_id?

The `doc_id` in the front matter uniquely identifies this document.
It follows the format defined in `.shirushi.yml`:

- `DOC` - Document type
- `2025` - Year created
- `0001` - Sequential number

## Next Steps

1. Run `shirushi lint` to validate all documents
2. Run `shirushi scan` to list all documents
3. Try creating a new document and assigning an ID
